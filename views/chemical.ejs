    <div class="container">
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>Chemical burns are tissue damage caused by strong acids, drain cleaners, paint thinner, gasoline and many other substances. Usually, you are aware of such a burn and its cause. But sometimes you may not immediately recognize a burn caused by a milder chemical.</p>

        <h3>Treatment and management</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Remove dry chemicals. Put on gloves and brush off any remaining material.</li>
            <li>Remove contaminated clothing or jewelry and rinse chemicals off for at least 20 minutes, in a shower if it's available. Protect your eyes from chemical contamination.</li>
            <li>Bandage the burn. Cover the burn with a clean bandage. Wrap it loosely to avoid putting pressure on burned skin.</li>
            <li>Rinse again if needed. If you feel more burning, rinse the area again for several more minutes.</li>
        </ul>
