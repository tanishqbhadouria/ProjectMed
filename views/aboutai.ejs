                  A study was conducted to determine the segmentation, classification,
                  object detection, and accuracy of skin burn images using artificial
                  intelligence and a mobile application. With this study, individuals
                  were able to determine the degree of burns and see how to intervene
                  through the mobile application.
            </p>
            <p>
                  Using a deep learning model the images were classified according to
                  the degree of burn along with their cure. The open-access dataset was
                  taken from Kaggle, and the burn images dataset was created. In this
                  project, a deep learning classification technique based on the
                  Convolution Neural Network (CNN) has been developed that distinguishes
                  between different degrees of skin burn depth in patients.

                  This method
                  utilizes burn images captured using digital or mobile phone cameras as
                  input to predict the degree of skin burns. In this study, skin burn
                  images were segemented, classified, object detected, and a mobile
                  application was developed using artificial intelligence.First aid is
                  crucial in burn cases, and it is an important development for public
                  health that people living in the periphery can quickly determine the
                  degree of burn through our web app and can take appropriate measures
                  accordingly.
