      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>
        Radiation burn or radiation dermatitis is a common side effect of
        external beam radiation therapy to treat some forms of cancer. This type
        of radiation therapy delivers radiation through a machine that targets
        cancerous cells. The treatment isn’t painful. But it can make your skin
        sore, peel, itch or turn red. That’s because radiation passes through
        your skin to its target.

      <h3>Treatment and diagnosis</h3>
      <p>
        Here are some ways you can protect your skin and ease your radiation
        burn symptoms:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Wash your irritated skin with mild soap and lukewarm water.</li>
        <li>Don’t rub or scratch your irritated skin.</li>
        <li>Don’t use heating pads or ice on your treatment area.</li>
        <li>Use moisturizing cream as directed.</li>
        <li>
          If you cover your treatment area with bandages, secure the bandages
          with paper tape so you don’t pull on your skin. Try to place the tape
          away from your treatment area and don’t put the tape in the same place
          each time.
        </li>
        <li>
          Wear loose, soft clothing that doesn’t rub against or irritate skin
          affected by radiation.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you need to shave your treatment area, use an electric razor to
          avoid irritating your skin.
        </li>
        <li>
          Stay out of the sun. Wear protective clothing any time you’re exposed
          to sunlight. Ask your healthcare provider if you should use sunscreen
          and what kind of sunscreen is best.
        </li>
        <li>
          Stay cool. Your skin may feel better if you’re able to spend time in
          cool humid environments. Use cool mist humidifiers to banish dryness.
        </li>
        <li>
          Talk to your provider before putting anything on your treatment area.
          This includes cosmetics, hair removal products, powders, creams,
          lotions, oils, ointments and perfumes.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Prevention</h3>
      <p>
        Not everyone develops radiation burn from radiation therapy. Talk to
        your healthcare provider about your specific treatment, including the
        area of your body to be treated and the treatment technique. Your
        provider will recommend ways to prevent radiation dermatitis or ease
        your symptoms.
