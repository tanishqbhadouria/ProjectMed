    <div class="container">
      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>
        Thermal burns are skin injuries caused by excessive heat, typically from
        contact with hot surfaces, hot liquids, steam, or flame. Most burns are
        minor and patients can be treated as outpatients or at local hospitals.
        Approximately 6.5 percent of all burn victims are treated in specialized
        burn centers. The decision to transfer and treat at burn centers is
        based on the extent of body surface area burned, the depth of the burns,
        and individual patient characteristics such as age, other injuries, or
        other medical problems.
      </p>

        <h3>Risk Factor</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Young age - children often come into contact with hot liquids</li>
        <li>
          Male gender - males are also at high risk for burn injuries chiefly
          due to occupation-related injuries. Additionally, flame burns are also
          common during the summer, as many people use gasoline products for
          recreation or farming. Alcohol consumption is a common risk factor in
          adults who suffer burn injuries
        </li>
        <li>Lack of smoke detectors in the home</li>
      </ul>

        <h3>Treatment and Management</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Step1: immediately stop the burning process by removing burning and hot items from skin contact
                Small areas of burn can be cooled with liquids like tap water or saline solution. If the patient has larger burns, be cautious of extensive cooling as this could lead to hypothermia
                Superficial burns need little more than over-the-counter pain medicine, topical analgesics, or topical aloe vera.
                 Partial-thickness and full-thickness burns are treated with cleansing, topical antibiotic ointments or occlusive dressings, pain medications, and tetanus booster if needed.
                </li>
                <li>Step2: Levels of carbon monoxide and cyanide need to be measured, and patients provided with oxygen. 
                    One should suspect cyanide toxicity in the presence of severe metabolic acidosis, normal arterial oxygen, and low carboxyhemoglobin.
                    </li>
                    <li>Step3: fluid resuscitation based on the parkland formula.
                        Crystalloids are preferable to colloids. One should be careful not to overhydrate and cause ARDs. Since there is a significant amount of protein loss during a burn, some centers do infuse 5% albumin. A foley should be inserted for the strict assessment of fluid balance.
                        </li>
                        <li>Step4: treating partial-thickness burns 
                            cover them with topical antibiotic ointments, like bacitracin or triple-antibiotic ointment, and then apply a simple absorbent dressing. The ointment can be spread on the dressing like peanut butter on bread, then placed on the burn. Dressings are changed once or twice a day and may take 1 to 2 weeks to heal. 
                            Silver sulfadiazine has historically been a commonly used topical antibiotic cream but is falling out of favor with growing evidence it can delay healing.
                            </li>
                            <li>Step5:
                                stabilization of the patient, surgical debridement and grafting are necessary
                                </li>
        </ul>
