            We recommend you to follow the prescribed remedy:</div>

        <div class="r">
            <ul>

                <li>To alleviate the discomfort, gently run cool water over the affected area of the burn to help soothe
                    the
                    skin and reduce inflammation.</li>

                <li>Apply ice on the burned part:The application of ice directly onto the burn as it may exacerbate the
                    damage to the skin and hinder
                    the healing process.</li>
                <li>
                    The burn has been cooled, carefully cover it with a clean and dry bandage to protect the area from
                    further irritation and to promote healing.
                </li>

                <li>If necessary, consider taking over-the-counter pain relievers such as Acetaminophen or Ibuprofen to
                    manage
                    any pain or discomfort associated with the burn. Ensure you follow the recommended dosage
                    instructions.</li>

                <li>In the case of sunburns, consider applying aloe vera gel to the affected area. Aloe vera is known
                    for its
                    soothing properties and can help to hydrate the skin and alleviate sunburn symptoms.</li>

                <li> For thermal burns, after cooling the burn with water, apply a thin layer of antibiotic cream to
                    prevent
                    infection. Then, lightly cover the burn with sterile gauze to protect it from further injury and
                    promote
                    healing. Remember to seek medical attention if the burn is severe or if there are signs of
                    infection.</li>

            We recommend you to follow the prescribed remedy:</div>

        <div class="r">

            <ul>
                <li>While you may not feel pain, the damage to your skin and tissues is severe and requires medical
                    attention.</li>
                <li>Cleaning your burn: Your provider will clean your skin by removing debris, dead skin and tissue from
                    the burned area. Donâ€™t try to remove anything from your burn before seeing a healthcare provider.
                </li>

                <li>Covering your burn: After cleaning your burn, your provider will place an antibiotic ointment on
                    your burn and gently cover your burn with a bandage. Itâ€™s important to keep your burn covered and
                    clean to prevent infections. You should change your bandage at least once daily. Your provider will
                    give you instructions on how to care for and clean your burn.</li>
                <li>
                    Antibiotics: You may need antibiotics to prevent or clear an infection from your body. If you have a
                    large third-degree burn, your provider may administer these antibiotics intravenously by placing a
                    needle into a vein in your arm to slowly give you the medicine you need. If you have a small
                    third-degree burn, you may take antibiotics by mouth.
                </li>

                <li>Pain medications: While you might not feel pain immediately after your burn, you may feel sore as
                    your body heals. Your provider may suggest over-the-counter pain relievers or medication to help you
                    feel more comfortable.</li>

                <li>Skin grafting or reconstructive surgery: For large third-degree burns, a healthcare provider may
                    offer skin grafting to help your wound close. Skin grafting takes healthy skin from another part of
                    your body to cover your wound. This is a surgical procedure, and there are other possible surgeries
                    that may help repair very severe damage.</li>

                <li> If you have an infected
                    burn, which is a burn thatâ€™s extremely painful, swollen and leaks pus, see a healthcare provider.
                    They may prescribe
                    antibiotics to clear the infection from your body.</li>
