<div class="container">
  
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>An electrical burn is a skin burn that happens when electricity comes in contact with your body.
    When electricity comes in contact with your body, it can travel through your body. When this happens, the electricity can damage tissues and organs. This damage can be mild or severe – and it can even cause death. Organs that are commonly damaged include the:
    Heart
    Bones and muscle system
    Nervous system 
    Eyes and ears
    </p>

    <h3>Types and tests</h3>
    <p> The terms doctors use to describe different types of burns are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Superficial – A superficial burn affects only the top layer of the skin. The skin is red, dry, and painful. When you press on the burn, it turns white.</li>
        <li>Partial-thickness – A partial-thickness burn affects the top 2 layers of the skin. The skin is red and can leak fluid or form blisters.</li>
        <li>Full-thickness – A full-thickness burn affects all the layers of the skin. The burn doesn't usually hurt, because the burned skin can't feel anything. The skin can be white, gray, or black.</li>

    </ul>

    <p>Tests can include:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Blood tests</li>
        <li>Urine tests</li>
        <li>An electrocardiogram (also called an "ECG") – This test measures the electrical activity in your heart</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<h3>Treatment and management</h3>
<p>Treatments for a mild skin burn can include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Cool the burn – You can put a cool cloth on your burn or soak it in cool water. Do not put ice on a burn.</li>
    <li>Cover the burn with a clean bandage – Your doctor might also recommend or prescribe a cream or ointment to soothe the skin or prevent an infection.</li>
    <li>Treat the pain – To ease your pain, you can raise the burned part of your body above the level of your heart. For example, you can prop your foot or leg up on pillows. You can also take an over-the-counter pain medicine, such as acetaminophen (sample brand name: Tylenol) or ibuprofen (sample brand names: Advil, Motrin).</li>
    <li>Get a tetanus shot, if it has been too many years since your last one.</li>
</ul>

<p>A severe skin burn is usually treated in the hospital. Treatments can include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Strong pain medicines</li>
    <li>Special bandages</li>
    <li>Antibiotic and other types of creams or ointments</li>
    <li>Surgery to repair the burned area</li>
</ul>
